# Greyp
Grey Palette for design prototyping

## Why
A small project to practice SCSS and Git. Also to save time in my own design process.

> Even when you’re ready to refine an idea in higher fidelity, resist the temptation to introduce color right away. By designing in grayscale, you’re forced to use spacing, contrast, and size to do all of the heavy lifting.
- Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger, *Refactoring UI*

## How
Edit the SCSS-variables to suit your own needs, i.e change from cool to warm colors:
`
$add-light: 5%;
$add-saturation: 10%;
$add-red: 1;
$add-green: 0;
$add-blue: 0;
`
